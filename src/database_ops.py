"""
This script handles various database operations.
It includes functionality to count rows in a query,
fetch a limited set of results from a query or multiple queries,
and execute database operations like insert and update on one or many records.

The DatabaseOperations class encapsulates these functionalities and 
can be used to interact with the database asynchronously.
