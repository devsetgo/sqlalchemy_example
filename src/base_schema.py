"""
This module defines the base schema for database models in the application.

It uses SQLAlchemy as the ORM and provides a `SchemaBase` class that all other models should inherit from.
The `SchemaBase` class includes common columns that are needed for most models like `_id`, `date_created`, and `date_updated`.

- `_id`: A unique identifier for each record. It's a string representation of a UUID.
- `date_created`: The date and time when a particular row was inserted into the table. 
  It defaults to the current UTC time when the instance is created.
- `date_updated`: The date and time when a particular row was last updated. 
  It defaults to the current UTC time whenever the instance is updated.

Import this module and extend the `SchemaBase` class to create new database models.
